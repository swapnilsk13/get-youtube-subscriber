## Introduction
Welcome to the YouTube Subscribers API Project! This project is designed to provide a simple API for managing and retrieving information about YouTube subscribers. It allows you to perform operations such as getting a list of subscribers, adding new subscribers, and fetching subscriber details.

## Project Overview
The project consists of a Node.js application that serves as the backend for the API and a MongoDB database for storing subscriber data. The frontend is a basic HTML page that provides information about the available API endpoints.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Bootstrap (for frontend styling)
- Mongoose (for database interaction)

## Installation
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine.

4. Start the application by running:
   ```
   node app.js
   ```

The application will start and listen on port 3000. You can access the API through the provided endpoints.

## Usage
The API provides the following endpoints for managing YouTube subscribers:

## API Endpoints
- `GET /subscribers`: Get a list of all subscribers.
- `POST /subscribers`: Add a new subscriber.
- `GET /subscribers/name`: Get a list of subscribers with only the `name` and `subscribedChannel` fields.
- `POST /subscribers/name`: Add a new subscriber with `name` and `subscribedChannel` fields.
- `GET /subscribers/:id`: Get details of a subscriber by their ID.
- `POST /subscribers/:id`: Add a new subscriber by providing `name` and `subscribedChannel`.

If a subscriber with the specified `:id` is not found, the API will return an error message with a status code of 400.

## Database
The project uses a MongoDB database to store subscriber data. You can configure the database connection in the `app.js` file. The database connection URL is set in the `DATABASE_URL` variable.

## Data Refresh
The project includes a data refresh feature. The `refreshAll` function in `app.js` clears the database and inserts a sample dataset of subscribers from the `data.js` file. You can use this function to reset the database with sample data.
